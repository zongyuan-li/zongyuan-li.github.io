I am an tenure-track assistant professor at [Department of Math, City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/). My research interests lie on analysis and partial differential equations, with a particular focus on elliptic regularity theories.

I received my PhD from [Division of Applied Math, Brown University](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/) in 2020, and my BA from [Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/mathen/join/list.htm). Before joining CityUHK, I served as a Hill Assistant Professor at [Rutgers University](https://math.rutgers.edu/).
