### Potential PhD positions ###
I am looking for motivated PhD students interested in PDEs. My reearch focuses on elliptic regularity theories, currently mainly including
  * Fully nonlinear elliptic equations, especially those arising from conformal geometry and those are not uniformly elliptic.
  * Linear elliptic equations with rough coefficients and boundaries.

Students with a solid background in analysis and a strong interest in PDEs are encouraged to apply.

Prospective applicants are welcome -- and encouraged -- to contact me before submitting a formal application.

* Last updated: May 2025 *
