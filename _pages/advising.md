I am looking for motivated PhD students interested in PDEs. My research focuses on elliptic regularity theories, currently mainly including
  * Linear equations and systems with rough coefficients on non-smooth domains.
  * Fully nonlinear elliptic equations, especially those arising from conformal geometry and those are non-uniform elliptic.

Students with a solid background in analysis and a strong interest in PDEs are encouraged to apply.

Interested applicants are encouraged to reach out before submitting a formal application.
